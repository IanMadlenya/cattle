cattle (corporate actions on the command-line)
==============================================

A simple library that handles corporate action events and applies them
to timeseries of market prices, outstanding securities and nominal
values.

In terms of that library a command-line tool `cattle` is built that can
reads [ISO15022][1] messages, stack them and then apply a timeseries of
corporate action events to a timeseries of prices, nominal values and
outstanding securities.

At the moment cattle is in the planning phase, so little can be shown
or explained here.

Pronunciation
-------------
cattle is correctly pronounced SEE-AYE-tool.
